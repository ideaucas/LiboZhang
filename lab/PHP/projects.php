            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">As early as 2003, Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China initiates a strategic plan of “National Facilities and Information Infrastructure for Science and Technology” with the goal to facilitate the sharing and collaboration of institutes and laboratories. Funded by Ministry of Science and Technology and as one of the six major projects focused on the network environment development, CBL is a vital component of the strategic plan. Its objective is to construct dynamic large-scale scientific instruments management platform, promote the efficiency of instruments and equipments, share technology achievement and provide effective network support environment for scientific research. National key laboratories in China need to expand their toolboxes from single, small field to beyond the laboratory in order to solve modern and more complex problems. Identifying solutions requires collection and integration of massive amounts of data and the involvement of domain experts, sociologists, educators, policy makers, and the general public. Modern problems require modern approach and technology to solve them. </p><br/>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">Biosafety laboratory serves as a key resource for conducting research to improve the means of detecting, preventing, and treating infectious diseases that occur naturally in the environment and are transmitted from animals to humans. For instance, it played an important role in the battle against SARS in 2003. The success of China's national biosafety framework development not only makes contribution to China's biosafety progress, but also provides guidance for other countries in the world to establish and realize international biosafety cooperation network. </p><br/>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">Currently there are only a little more than ten biosafety laboratories in China. Although someone else is under construction, apparently these facilities can not fulfill the overall requirements of the whole country. Also, these research centers are distributed in well developed cities in China, i.e. Beijing and Shanghai. As a result other undeveloped areas always have difficulty to utilize expensive experiment instruments and to share experience with these research centers. The low utilization of the instruments slows down the progress of the biosafety research and block laboratories from playing a more important role in the prevention of diseases. Finally, establishing a collaborative environment is significant to accelerate the research on a global scale. </p><br/>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">According to the statistics of the government, the utility of China’s large-scale scientific instruments is only 25%. And it’s about 170% to 200% in western developed countries. In the future, the large scale science will increasingly be carried out through distributed global collaborations enabled by the Internet. This trend is well known as e-Science. Typically, a feature of such collaborative scientific enterprises is that they will require access to very large data collections, very large scale experiment instruments and high performance computational power to the individual scientist users. </p><br/>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p style="margin-left:50px;">Fundamental changes in computer architecture and increases in network capacity are encouraging software developers to take new approaches to computer-science problem solving. For web software such as search, social networking and mobile commerce to run quickly, computational tasks often need to be broken into hundreds or thousands of smaller pieces to run across many servers simultaneously. Parallel programming techniques are also used for complex scientific analysis such as gene sequencing and climate modeling. But the universities face the challegnes in teaching important new concepts such as large scale computing and develop methods to address these issues. The project's goal is to intensify the cooperation between the universities in EU and in Asia and to promote education and research in high performance computing and grid computing (HPC&GC). It also aims to help the Asian partner universities to initialize/improve their education program in this area through working visits and staff training programs, and joint supervision of PhD students. The project will develop a joint course module in HPC/GC for graduate students in computational science and engineering, computer science and other engineering disciplines. The course will be jointly taught by different professors at the participating universities using the Internet. The final assignment is to be studied by teams, each consisting of students from different countries. This provides students the opportunity for gaining experience on how to cooperate with people at long term in the wake of globalisation and web/grid technology. </p><br/>
